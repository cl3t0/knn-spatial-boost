# KNN Spatial Boost

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Using a machine learning model to obtain a huge amount of simple
patterns from coordinates without any other feature becomes difficult
because it depends on how much information your model can learn. KNN, as
a non-parametric algorithm, can address this problem, but struggles with
more complex patterns. Hereâ€™s KNN Spatial Boost algorithm comes in.

## Install

``` sh
pip install knn_spatial_boost
```

## How to use

In the example we are going to use the MLPRegressor from the
scikit-learn library.

``` python
from knn_spatial_boost.core import KNNSpatialBooster
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

nn = KNNSpatialBooster(
    n_neighbors=2,
    spatial_features=[1, 2],
    estimator=MLPRegressor()
)
```
